          I enjoy improvement in many aspects, whether it's improving at a video
          game, learning a new language or using unfamiliar tech with software
          development. This mindset has helped me grow, not only technically,
          but also as a person during my time with School of Code.

          Currently, I spend my free time working on side projects, watching
          movies or anime, sometimes playing video games, spending time with
          family relaxing or recently I've been learning Japanese and delved
          deeper into the culture as I have a trip planned next year.
