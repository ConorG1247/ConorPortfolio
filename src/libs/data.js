      "After spending two weeks learning React, I wanted to push myself by creating a full-stack app using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js to help cement what I'd learnt and also expand my knowledge on other tech I hadn't previously used. ",
      "Over a three week period, I created an app which allows a user to view and search anime and movies using several different API's including IMDb, OMDb and Jikan. User's can add a movie or anime they've found to a watchlist which is stored in a Mongo database and remove it later once they've watched it.",
      "I found it challenging at times, but also very exciting to be putting what I'd learnt to use as well as becoming more comfortable with React, CSS, MongoDB and Chakra UI.",

      "After creating my Anime and Movies API app, I wanted to continue growing my knowledge of React so I set out to create a single page app with mobile users in mind.",
      "I settled on the idea of an app which helps with learning a new language, in this case Japanese, in a structured and organised way. The user is given several options to choose from which affect the diffuculty of what they're learning, the game type and the amount of rounds they want to practice for.",
      "This is an ongoing project as I am still new to learning Japanese and I'm developing this as I progress, I've found it helpful with memorizing a lot of the Japanese alphabet as well as some phrases and words.",
      "Creating the logic for the flash cards system was more challenging than I'd expected, but I feel I've improved with React and JavaScript a great amount since starting and hope I will continue to grow the more I develop this app.",
